# BMS-Docs
A set of Markdown documents detailing BMS, written by and for the community

## Holy cow! How do I help?
Not to worry, Git is easy to use! First, you'll need to set up an account. Go do that now; Its free, and we'll wait.

Once you have that sorted out, at the upper right of this page, above the settings button, you should see a button labelled 'Fork'. Click that - it will make a copy of this set of documentation, which you can edit and distribute as you like. The important part of that is that once you have made edits, you can notify me of those edits and request them for inclusion in the main project here, with a 'pull request'. 

## Ive made some changes to my version. How do I make a 'Pull Request'?
If you click the Code tab at the left of the page, that will take you back to the main page for your version of the project. Theres a 'New Pull Request' button there. Click it, and it will show you a summary of your changes, and give you a button to open a Pull Request for the project. I can then review the changes, and add them to the project here for everyone!

## What if my changes arent ready to be shared yet?
If you submit a pull request that isnt quite ready, I can also comment on the changes, offer suggestions, feedback, or reject the request. Theres no rush on it though, you can open a request and then make further changes. 

## That sounds pretty great
It really does! Ready to hop in?
