# Acronyms
This file lists acronyms used in BMS documents, here and elsewhere, that are relevant to either the F-16, or Falcon BMS. Acronyms are given a short explanation, but a full definition or explanation of the system in question is outside the scope of this document. Short very commonly used abbreviations that are not specific to Falcon BMS or the F-16 will not be explained here (and arguably should not be used in the documentation).
